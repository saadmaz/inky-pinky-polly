# 🎮 Inky Pinky Polly

Welcome to **Inky Pinky Polly**, a creative twist on the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask). This fun, interactive project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Programming** module at **[Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.ac.lk)**, Level 3.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Instead of the traditional “rock, paper, scissors,” this game introduces three quirky characters:

- 🌸 **Pinky** beats 🌀 **Inky**
- 🌀 **Inky** beats 🐦 **Polly**
- 🐦 **Polly** beats 🌸 **Pinky**

You’ll go head-to-head against a robotic opponent named **BOT-47** in a game of quick decisions and strategy.
